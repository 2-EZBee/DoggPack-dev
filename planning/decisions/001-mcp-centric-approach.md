# ADR-001: Adopt MCP-Centric Architecture for DoggPack Infrastructure

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-02  
**Deciders**: DoggPack AI Team  
**Technical Impact**: High  
**Business Impact**: High  

## Context and Problem Statement

The DoggPack ecosystem requires an intelligent, AI-driven infrastructure management approach that can coordinate between multiple Claude instances (CDTZ on ZenDogg, CCN on NucDogg, CCW on WorkDogg) while maintaining the ability to eventually migrate to local AI models. 

Traditional infrastructure management tools don't provide the natural language interface and AI coordination capabilities needed for our vision of "describe what you want, AI implements it."

We need to choose an architecture that:
- Enables coordination between multiple AI instances
- Provides standardized tool interfaces
- Supports future migration to local AI models
- Maintains security and reliability
- Reduces complexity for AI-driven deployments

## Decision Drivers

- **AI-First Philosophy**: Infrastructure should be managed through natural language, not manual configuration
- **Multi-Instance Coordination**: CDTZ plans, CCN and CCW execute in coordination
- **Future-Proofing**: Must support migration from Claude API to local models
- **Subscription Constraints**: Cannot afford per-token API usage, must use existing Claude subscriptions
- **Security Requirements**: Isolated development environments with controlled access to production
- **Standardization**: Need consistent interfaces across all AI tools and services

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Traditional Infrastructure + AI Helper
**Description**: Use standard tools (Docker Compose, Ansible, Terraform) with AI assistance for generation

**Pros**:
- Familiar tools and patterns
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Well-established best practices
- Easy to find talent

**Cons**:
- AI becomes an add-on, not core to the architecture
- No coordination between AI instances
- Still requires significant manual configuration
- Doesn't achieve "natural language â†’ infrastructure" vision
- Each AI interaction is isolated

**Implementation Complexity**: Low
**Risk Level**: Low

### Option 2: Custom AI Orchestration Layer
**Description**: Build custom APIs and coordination layer specifically for AI-driven infrastructure

**Pros**:
- Tailored exactly to our needs
- Full control over coordination mechanisms
- Can optimize for our specific use cases
- No external dependencies

**Cons**:
- High development effort
- Custom protocols and interfaces
- Maintenance burden
- No ecosystem or community support
- Risk of reinventing existing solutions poorly

**Implementation Complexity**: High
**Risk Level**: High

### Option 3: MCP-Centric Architecture
**Description**: Use Model Context Protocol as the backbone for all AI-infrastructure interactions

**Pros**:
- Standardized protocol designed for AI tool interactions
- Works with existing Claude subscriptions (no API costs)
- Enables coordination between multiple AI instances
- Future-compatible with local AI models
- Growing ecosystem of MCP tools
- Can leverage existing MCP servers (Asana, GitHub, etc.)
- Clear separation between AI logic and infrastructure tools

**Cons**:
- Relatively new protocol (less mature ecosystem)
- Need to build some custom MCP servers
- Learning curve for MCP development
- Dependency on MCP protocol stability

**Implementation Complexity**: Medium
**Risk Level**: Medium

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: MCP-Centric Architecture

**Rationale**: 

The MCP-centric approach best aligns with our core requirements while providing a clear migration path for future evolution. Specifically:

1. **Cost Alignment**: Uses existing Claude subscriptions rather than expensive API calls
2. **Coordination Capability**: MCP servers can maintain shared state and coordinate between Claude instances
3. **Standardization**: Provides consistent interfaces that work across different AI backends
4. **Future-Proofing**: When we migrate to local AI, we only need to change the AI client, not the tool interfaces
5. **Ecosystem Leverage**: Can use existing MCP servers for Asana, GitHub, etc.
6. **Development Efficiency**: Focus on building domain-specific tools rather than AI coordination infrastructure

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Natural language interface to all infrastructure operations
- Coordinated deployments across multiple Claude instances  
- Standardized tool interfaces that work with any MCP-compatible AI
- Cost-effective use of existing Claude subscriptions
- Growing ecosystem of reusable MCP tools
- Clear upgrade path to local AI models

**Negative**:
- Need to learn MCP development patterns
- Some custom MCP server development required
- Dependency on relatively new protocol
- May need to work around MCP limitations
- Smaller community compared to traditional infrastructure tools

**Neutral**:
- Different development patterns than traditional infrastructure code
- New debugging and monitoring approaches needed
- Documentation and training materials need to be developed

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1**: MCP Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Deploy core MCP servers (planning coordination, Docker management, system monitoring)
- Configure all Claude instances with MCP connections
- Establish basic coordination patterns

**Phase 2**: Essential Services (Weeks 3-4)
- Build deployment workflows using MCP coordination
- Implement external API integration through MCP proxy
- Deploy first services (N8N, VNC desktops) using AI coordination

**Phase 3**: Advanced Coordination (Weeks 5-6)
- Implement sophisticated multi-instance workflows
- Build Windows control application for CDTZ
- Create monitoring and optimization tools

**Phase 4**: Production Readiness (Weeks 7-8)
- Implement comprehensive error handling and rollback
- Add security hardening and audit trails
- Create documentation and operational procedures

**Timeline**: 8 weeks for full implementation
**Resources Required**: 
- Docker infrastructure across 3 machines
- MCP server development capabilities
- Claude Code access on all machines
- Network connectivity between machines

## Validation Criteria

**Success Metrics**:
- Can deploy new services through natural language requests
- Claude instances coordinate effectively without conflicts
- External integrations (Asana, GitHub) work from isolated environments
- Deployment time reduced by >50% compared to manual processes
- Zero cost increase due to API usage
- Successful migration to local AI within 6 months

**Review Schedule**:
- 30-day review: Assess MCP server stability and Claude coordination
- 60-day review: Evaluate deployment efficiency and user experience
- 90-day review: Plan for local AI migration preparation

**Reconsideration Triggers**:
- MCP protocol breaking changes
- Inability to achieve coordination between Claude instances
- Performance issues that can't be resolved
- Security vulnerabilities that can't be mitigated
