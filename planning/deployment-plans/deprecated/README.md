# Deprecated Deployment Plans

This folder contains deployment plans that have been deprecated due to hardware limitations, architectural changes, or other constraints that make them no longer viable.

## Currently Deprecated Plans

### network-infrastructure-security-2025-08-03.yml
- **Reason**: VLAN-based approach not supported by TP-Link Deco X20 DSL hardware
- **Date Deprecated**: August 6, 2025
- **Replacement**: Single-network security approach using WiFi segmentation and access control
- **Status**: Preserved for historical reference, marked as NOT IMPLEMENTABLE

## Deprecation Process

When a deployment plan becomes obsolete:

1. **Move to deprecated folder** with original filename and date
2. **Add deprecation header** to the original file explaining why it was deprecated
3. **Update documentation** to reference new approach
4. **Create replacement plan** if applicable
5. **Update project status** to reflect changes

## Historical Value

Deprecated plans are maintained for:
- Understanding evolution of architectural decisions
- Reference for future planning efforts
- Lessons learned documentation
- Compliance with project change management

These plans should NOT be used for implementation.
