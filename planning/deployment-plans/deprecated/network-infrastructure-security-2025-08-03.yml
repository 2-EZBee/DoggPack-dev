description: |
  DEPRECATED: Complete network security implementation with VLAN segmentation,
  VPN server, and firewall rules. This plan is invalid due to discovered
  router hardware limitations.
  
  ACHIEVEMENT: DNS server setup (Phase 1) was completed successfully.
  
  REQUIRED: Complete networking plan revision for single-network approach.

# This deployment plan is no longer valid due to hardware constraints
# Original plan assumed enterprise-grade router capabilities
# TP-Link Deco X20 DSL is a consumer mesh system with limited features

# Original VLAN plan (now invalid):
# VLAN 10: Infrastructure (192.168.10.0/24)
# VLAN 20: SmartHome (192.168.20.0/24) 
# VLAN 30: Gaming (192.168.30.0/24)
# VLAN 40: Personal (192.168.40.0/24)

# Current reality:
# Single network: 192.168.68.0/24
# DNS server: 192.168.68.40 (operational)
# Security: Requires alternative approach
