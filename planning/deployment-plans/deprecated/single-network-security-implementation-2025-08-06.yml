archive_reason: "Created before discovering TP-Link Deco X20 DSL lacks VPN server and access control features"

  DEPRECATED: This plan was created as a fallback when VLANs were discovered
  to be unsupported, but further investigation revealed the router lacks
  additional required features:
  - No VPN server capability
  - No access control groups  
  - No advanced firewall rules
  - Very limited configuration options
  
  This plan is invalid and requires complete redesign.

hardware_limitations_discovered:
  router: "TP-Link Deco X20 DSL"
  limitations:
    - "No internal VLAN support"
    - "No VPN server functionality"  
    - "No access control groups"
    - "No advanced firewall configuration"
    - "No port forwarding advanced options"
    - "Consumer mesh system with basic features only"

original_assumptions_invalid:
  - "Assumed VPN server could be configured on router"
  - "Assumed access control rules could isolate IoT devices"
  - "Assumed advanced port forwarding was available"
  - "Assumed firewall rules could be customized"

phases:
  phase1_dns:
    status: "completed"
    notes: "Successfully implemented - DNS server operational"
    
  phase2_security:
    status: "invalid"
    reason: "Router lacks required security features"

  next_steps:
    - "Complete router capability assessment"
    - "Research software-defined security solutions"
    - "Consider router replacement options"
    - "Develop interim security measures using available features"

# This plan attempted to work around VLAN limitations but
# discovered even more fundamental limitations in the router
# A completely different approach is required

required_new_approach:
  - "Software-defined security on DoggPack infrastructure"
  - "Third-party VPN solutions (Tailscale, WireGuard, etc.)"
  - "Application-level access controls"
  - "Router replacement planning for future VLAN implementation"
  - "Cloudflare Zero Trust for external access"
