# DoggPack Network Security Implementation Guide

**ARCHIVED**: This document was archived on August 6, 2025 due to router hardware limitations.

**Router**: TP-Link Deco X20 DSL
**Limitation**: No support for internal VLANs, VPN server, or advanced firewall rules
**Status**: VLAN-based security approach is INVALID for current hardware
**DNS Achievement**: Phase 1 DNS server remains operational and valid

# Original VLAN-Based Security Plan (INVALID)

[This would contain the full network security implementation guide that was planned for VLAN segmentation, but is now invalid due to hardware constraints]

## Hardware Requirements (NOT MET)
- ✅ Router with VLAN support (❌ Deco X20 DSL does not support)
- ✅ VPN server capability (❌ Deco X20 DSL does not support)  
- ✅ Advanced firewall rules (❌ Deco X20 DSL does not support)
- ✅ Access control groups (❌ Deco X20 DSL does not support)

## What Was Successfully Completed
✅ **DNS Server Setup**: NasDogg DNS operational at 192.168.68.40
✅ **Domain Records**: All .doggpack.local records configured
✅ **DNS Resolution**: Internal and external resolution working

## What Requires Redesign
❌ **Network Segmentation**: Must use alternative approach
❌ **VPN Access**: Must use third-party solution
❌ **Remote Access**: Must reconfigure for single-network
❌ **IoT Isolation**: Must use guest network approach

**Archive Reason**: Router hardware does not support required security features
**Next Steps**: Develop single-network security strategy within hardware constraints
**Status**: Requires complete networking plan revision
