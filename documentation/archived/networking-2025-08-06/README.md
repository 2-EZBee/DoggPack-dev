# Archived Networking Documents - August 6, 2025

## 🚨 **Reason for Archival**

These networking documents were archived on **August 6, 2025** after discovering that the current router hardware (TP-Link Deco X20 DSL) does not support the required network security features.

## ❌ **Hardware Limitations Discovered**

**Router**: TP-Link Deco X20 DSL
- ❌ **No internal VLAN support** (only WAN-side IPTV/VLAN tagging)
- ❌ **No VPN server capability**  
- ❌ **No access control groups**
- ❌ **No firewall rule customization**
- ❌ **No advanced port forwarding options**
- ❌ **Consumer mesh system** with basic features only

## 📂 **Archived Documents**

### **User Guides**
- `network-quick-reference.md` - VLAN configuration and network reference (INVALID)
- `network-security-implementation.md` - Complete VLAN security guide (INVALID)

### **Deployment Plans** 
- `network-infrastructure-security-2025-08-03.yml` - Original VLAN deployment plan (INVALID)
- `single-network-security-implementation-2025-08-06.yml` - Revised VLAN plan (INVALID)

## ✅ **What Was Successfully Completed**

### **Phase 1: DNS Server Setup (COMPLETE)**
- ✅ **NasDogg DNS Server**: Fully configured and operational
- ✅ **doggpack.local zone**: All A and CNAME records working
- ✅ **DNS forwarders**: Cloudflare (1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1) configured
- ✅ **Testing confirmed**: Internal and external DNS resolution working

**DNS accomplishments are NOT affected** by the router limitations and remain valid.

## 🔄 **Next Steps Required**

1. **Develop new network security approach** that works within router constraints
2. **Consider software-defined security solutions** (pfSense, reverse proxies, etc.)
3. **Plan router replacement strategy** for future VLAN implementation  
4. **Implement interim security measures** using available tools

## 🎯 **Current Status**

- **DNS Phase**: ✅ Complete and operational
- **Network Security Phase**: ❌ Requires complete redesign
- **Foundation Infrastructure**: ⏸️ On hold pending new network plan

## 📋 **Key Information to Preserve**

### **Network Details (Still Valid)**
- **Current network**: 192.168.68.0/24 (35+ devices)
- **DoggPack machines**: Ready for configuration
  - NasDogg: 192.168.68.40 (DNS server operational)
  - NucDogg, WorkDogg, ZenDogg: Ready for new plan
- **Internet connection**: VDSL2, 82Mbps down/22Mbps up, stable
- **DNS server**: Fully operational at 192.168.68.40

### **Port Allocation Strategy (Still Valid)**
The port allocation planning from these archived documents remains valid and should be used in the new networking approach.

**Archive Date**: August 6, 2025  
**Archive Reason**: Router hardware limitations discovered during Phase 2 implementation  
**Status**: Requires complete networking plan revision
