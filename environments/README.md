# Environment Configurations

Environment-specific configurations for the DoggPack infrastructure.

## Environment Structure

- **development/**: Development environment configurations
- **staging/**: Staging environment configurations  
- **production/**: Production environment configurations

## Environment Management

### Configuration Strategy

- Base configurations in main implementation directory
- Environment-specific overrides in respective directories
- Secrets managed through environment variables
- Network configurations isolated per environment

### Environment Promotion

```
Development → Staging → Production
```

1. **Development**: Isolated containers, local testing
2. **Staging**: Production-like environment for final validation
3. **Production**: Live DoggPack infrastructure

### Configuration Files

Each environment directory contains:

- `docker-compose.override.yml` - Environment-specific service configurations
- `secrets.env.template` - Template for environment secrets
- `network-config.yml` - Network topology configuration
- `resource-limits.yml` - Resource allocation limits
- `monitoring-config.yml` - Monitoring and alerting configuration

## Environment Access

- **Development**: All Claude instances have full access
- **Staging**: Controlled access, limited external integrations
- **Production**: Restricted access, full external integrations

## Security Considerations

- Never commit actual secrets to repository
- Use environment-specific service accounts
- Implement network isolation between environments
- Regular security audits of production configurations
